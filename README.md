# **Smart Classroom Management Software for Enhanced Learning Environments**

## **Overview**

A Smart Classroom Monitoring and Management Software that integrates facial recognition, noise detection, behavior analysis, emergency alert and many more to automate essential classroom operations, address safety concerns, efficiently manage resources, and provide detailed periodical insights. Our proposed solution provides an one-stop solution for every institution by integrating all aspects of classroom management into a single, unified platform to minimize manual labour, time wastage and focus only on teaching and learning.

## **Key Features**
- **Automated Attendance Tracking**: Fully Automatic Attendance from classroom footage using facial recognition and tracking to eliminate manual labour, save time and avoid proxies.
- **Improving Student Engagement**: Monitoring Classroom behaviour patterns of every student to ensure active participation and identify non-attentive students.
- **Detecting Noisy Classrooms**: Identifying noise percentage in classrooms to enable teachers and administrators to take necessary actions.
- **Enhancing Safety**: Detecting unauthorized entry of students from different classes, as well as fire or smoke, to send immediate notifications to the authorities.
- **Studentsâ€™ Seating Pattern Detection**: Detecting noisy groups in the classroom helps teachers to conduct classes more effectively. Also detecting seating pattern of students in different classes using row identification.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Monitoring usage pattern of Resources (e.g. projectors, computers) to determine usage time and automatically schedule maintenance.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Generate graphical data and weekly reports of individual students in each subject to help teachers in assessments and evaluations.




## **Technologies Used**

### **Algorithm Development**
- **Python**: The primary programming language for algorithm development and implementation.
- **PyTorch**: For training and fine-tuning the object detection model.
- **YOLOv8**: Utilized for real-time object detection within the video frames.
- **DeepFace**: Employed for advanced facial matching.
- **OpenCV**: Used for video processing.
- **DBSCAN**: clustering for group detection in the classroom environment.
- **Numpy & Pandas**: Data manipulation, analysis and processing.

### **Frontend**
- **Next.js**: Framework used for building the frontend of the web application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for designing and styling the web interface.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for creating and styling the web interface.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static type definitions to JavaScript, improving code quality and maintainability.

### **Backend**
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building web applications.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for server-side development.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used for schema definition and data modeling.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing and managing data.
- **Flask**: Web application framework for Python.
